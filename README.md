# Automation Without Exposure
## Securing Your DevOps Pipeline

### My Experience
* Over a decade in development (backend, frontend, mobile)
* Two years in DevOps (focused on CI and automation)
* Now a Security Engineer (works directly with engineering and architecture teams)

### DevSecOps... SecDevOps... OpsSecDev?
> In today's agile world, we have less time between releases than ever before, and this crunch is often felt by security more than any other team. The risk of a breach due to a rushed product is high but the risk of lost profit due to a missed launch is far higher, so how do we prevent both? Using the same techniques we used to automate our builds and releases we can automate our security testing. 

### Fantastic Tools and Where to Deploy Them
* Code
  * Static Analysis
  * Unit Testing
* Build
	* Binary Analysis
	* Open Source Analysis
* Deploy
	* Dynamic Analysis
	* Continuous Monitoring

### Feedback Loops and Echo Chambers
* By introducing multiple methods of testing throughout the build and release process we provide our team blunt and honest feedback
* Too often this feedback thought of as a road block and turned into a checklist of extra work required to launch
* Treat each piece of information found as a training opportunity, help your team resolve the issue and advance their skills

### Education Through Automation
* It is very easy to just “fix” a bug via acceptance or mitigation, but then it will happen again and again
* Most good tools will provide some form of explanation on the bug as well links to third party sources to help learn more about them
* Keep track of bugs that pop up regularly and on a annual basis introduce some form of training (conferences, local meet-ups, lunch and learn, e-learning) that focuses on these topics

### Automation Induced Anxiety
* Set your priorities and expectations in stone
* Use the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), but use it properly
* Use a ticketing system to help manage the load
